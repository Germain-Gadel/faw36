## Info

The PCB is reversible as well as the top and bottom plate.

The PCB support both MX hotswap sockets and standard 5 pin MX solderable footprint.

As for the diodes the PCB supports both THT and SOD123 footprints.

Then encoders are EC11 but as of today only the left one is working.
## Lore

The name comes from the four color theorem which state that.
```
No more than four colors are required to color the regions of any map 
so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.
```
And written on the PCB is the letter of De Morgan to Hamilton to Sir William Rowan Hamilton in which he explains the findings of his student.
